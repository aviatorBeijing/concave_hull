concave_hull
============

C/Python code to generate 2D alpha-shape (concave hull). I am only concerned about the 2D points set. No higher dimension is considered. 
In the following references, all C routines and Python script are provided by other authors. But it just doesn't work right away. 
I need to modify the code here and there. So to save the effort in the future, I modified them, and uploaded here.
